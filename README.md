https://l2rpn.chalearn.org/competitions

## Pypownet Installation
### Requirements:
*   Python >= 3.6
*   Virtual Environment Recommended

```
cd L2RPN/
python setup.py install
```
Pypownet Introduction: https://github.com/MarvinLer/pypownet

## Basic Usage
### Runing Test
```
python Run_and_Submit_agent.py
```
You can modify the testing number of chronics and timesteps in the 'Run_and_Submit_agent.py' file.

### Train Your Model
```
python -m pypownet.main -f train
```
To see all the options:
```
python -m pypownet.main --help
```
